#### 为来的教育是什么样的？

教育模式需要随着社会生产方式的改变而改变。在中国的很多地方，之前的教育模式专注于培养一个高分的孩子，忽略了孩子的兴趣所在，容易造成孩子们为了学而学。这就导致了这些学生在毕业之后可能会找不到工作。

所以，我认为未来的教育模式要根据孩子的兴趣，在学习知识的同时，锻炼他们的工程能力。就像西安交大王树国校长说的，高校的教育出来的学生要满足企业的需求，以社会需要什么样的学生，高校就要培养什么样的学生。

基于马云的观点，我认未来的教育是培养出一个拥有丰富知识储备且有创造力和想象力的学生。一个优秀的大学生需要具备智慧，领导力，担当力，责任心和独立思考的能力，他勇于尝试，不怕失败。未来的教育需要教育出一个热爱自己，热爱生活的人，教育出一个机器代替不了的人，让一个孩子成为一个真正的人。



#### What is the future education like?
​	The educational mode needs to change with the change of social production mode. In many parts of China, the previous education model focused on cultivating a child with high scores, ignoring the interests of children, which is easy to cause children to learn in order to learn. This leads to these students may not find jobs after graduation.
​	Therefore, I believe that the future education model should be based on children's interests, and exercise their engineering ability while learning knowledge. As President Wang Shuguo of Xi'an Jiaotong University said, the students educated by colleges and universities should meet the needs of enterprises. Colleges and universities should cultivate what kind of students the society needs.
​	Based on Ma Yun's point of view, I believe that the future education is to cultivate a student with rich knowledge reserves, creativity and imagination. An excellent college student needs wisdom, leadership, responsibility, and the ability to think independently. He is brave to try and not afraid of failure. The future education needs to educate a person who loves himself and life, educate a person who cannot be replaced by a machine, and make a child a real person.
